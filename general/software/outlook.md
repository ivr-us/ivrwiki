# Outlook

This setup walks you through logging into your University Mail in Outlook.

:::tip
If you have to access your Mail fast, use [Webmail](https://mail.uni-stuttgart.de)
:::

:::warning Correct Outlook version
Make sure to always use the Outlook installed with Microsoft Office, often called "Outlook **(classic)**". Never use "Outlook **(new)** as it is not compliant with GDPR and is missing features
:::

1. Open Outlook (classic)
2. In the Text field type in your ivr-Address, so firstname.lastname@ivr.uni-stuttgart.de
3. Select `Advanced options` and tick `Let me set up my account manually`
4. Now select `Exchange` (not the 2013 version)
5. Wait (takes a few minutes sometimes). If a small <Popover text="Pop-up" path="/outlook-allow-configuration-by-server.png" :width="500"/> shows, tick the checkbox and select `Allow`.
6. After some more time, a <Popover text="User Access Control dialog" path="/uac-dialog.png" /> will show. As username enter your ac in long form (`acXXXXXX@uni-stuttgart.de`) and the password of your ac. Tick the `Remember my credentials` box and click `OK`.
7. In the last dialog for the sync time slide the slider all to the right and click `OK`.
